  <h1 id="About">About Sahayyam</h2>
    <p>Rapid socio-economic change, including more nuclear families, is also making Elder Care management difficult,
      especially for busy adult children responsible for their older parents’ wellbeing. Managing Home Care for the
      elderly is a massive challenge as multiple service providers, who often do not talk to each other, are involved in
      providing that care -nursing agencies, physiotherapists, medical suppliers. Most of these providers are small,
      unorganized players who extend sub-optimal care quality.<br> <br>
      Wandering cattle in public places is probably the defining image of India in the West.
      With wandering cattle causing frequent accidents, especially involving two-wheelers.At least 50 per cent of the
      animals die either immediately or after a few days.
      India also has fewer government and NGO services that deal with stray cattles. Many countries have organisations
      like Animal Control, the Humane Society, the SPCA, private shelters, and rescue organisations, that take care of
      the stray cattles problems.
      <br><br>There are 3-4 road accident cases of stray dogs each day. The actual number could be much more because
      many people don't bother informing the MC or our organisation whenever they accidentally hit an animal. They
      simply let it die and speed away.But when someone good hearted tries to help the needy, he is lost of sources or
      guidance.
      However,a few lucky animals who are treated successfully may be adopted by somebody.
      With a view to save stray animals, especially dogs and cats,we have created a platform, Sahayyam, which will allow
      the user to locate its nearby NGOs, civil societies and vets which have been verified by us, provide the stray the
      proper treatment they require.

      <p>
        In our society, when we’re not sure of something, we ask Google. Google spends its resources scouring the Web
        trying to predict what will be the most relevant content to show users for their 3.5 billion searches per day.
        Usually, Google’s guesses are accurate, but sometimes they’re not.
        If you google,"Dog shelters in Hamirpur", most of the search results comprise of animal husbandry farms or even
        dog breeders, which could lead to the loss of victim.This inspired us to develop Sahayyam.
        The mission of sahayyam is to raise awareness and support the works of various NGOs in the field of animal
        sheltering & care and old-age people. We are trying to become a bridge between common folks to needed ones who
        seek to help old
        people
        and homeless pets to thrive. Can you help?
